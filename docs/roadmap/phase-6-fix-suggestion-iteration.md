# Phase 6 — Fix Suggestion & Safe Iteration (Northstar gap #2)

**Status:** PLANNED
**Horizon:** Next
**Last Updated:** 2026-06-17

## Goal

Close the loop: draft minimal, surgical `SKILL.md` edits from *observed* evidence,
prove them by A/B in a throwaway worktree, and let a human land them — skillet
never commits. This is the Northstar's #2 value gap (AI-assisted fix suggestion)
and the *Suggest → Apply → Re-measure* arc. Drafting is constrained to discovered
failures, never imagined ones.

## Key Features

1. Draft edit proposals (CLI: `skillet suggest`) — PLANNED · Ported
   - Purpose & user value: From the failure taxonomy, the cited `SKILL.md`
     passages, and corrective-turn excerpts, the judge drafts *minimal surgical*
     content-anchored `EditProposal`s — generalize from feedback, prefer deleting
     dead prose and extracting to `references/`, explain the why. Nothing is
     applied.
   - Northstar: gap #2 made executable.
   - Success metrics:
     - `suggest <skill> --from <evidence-id>` emits `EditProposal`s (`current_excerpt` → `proposed_text`, `rationale`, `addresses`) to `.skillet/proposals/`.
     - Proposals draft only against observed evidence; each records its `motivation` evidence ids.
   - Dependencies: findings (Phase 4), evidence (Phase 3), judge (Phase 2).
   - Confidence: Medium — design §6.1 `suggest`, §7.3.

2. Safe apply to the working tree (CLI: `skillet suggest --apply[=<indices>]`) — PLANNED · Net-new
   - Purpose & user value: Materialize a reviewed proposal into your working tree
     via content-anchored application (exact-once match, refuse-on-ambiguity,
     fail-loud on drift) — refusing a dirty tree and stopping short of the commit.
     The deliberate, safer P5 amendment.
   - Northstar: gap #2 (automates the apply step the human used to do by hand).
   - Success metrics:
     - `suggest --apply=<i>` writes selected edits to the working tree, refuses a dirty tree, and never commits.
     - An anchor that matches zero or >1 times aborts loudly with a remedy.
   - Dependencies: proposals (F1), content-anchored `EditApply` engine.
   - Confidence: Medium — design §6.1 `suggest`, §7.3.

3. Prove a proposal by A/B (CLI: `skillet iterate --proposals <f> --apply <indices>`) — PLANNED · Ported
   - Purpose & user value: Apply a proposal subset into a *throwaway git worktree*
     (the live skill untouched), run the pinned suite at k, and print the per-eval
     `pass^k` delta against the baseline — proving the fix before any human lands
     it.
   - Northstar: gap #2 (the "prove it" half) + loop integrity.
   - Success metrics:
     - `iterate` reports before/after `pass^k` at observed k with no regressions to call a proposal proven.
     - Any regression discards the worktree and exits `1`, emitting nothing unless `--keep-worktree`.
   - Dependencies: runner (Phase 1), proposals (F1), worktree lifecycle.
   - Confidence: Medium — design §6.1 `iterate`, §10.

4. Mark evidence proven (CLI: `skillet iterate --mark`) — PLANNED · Net-new
   - Purpose & user value: On a clean, regression-free A/B, advance the linked
     friction event to `proven` — an explicit, auditable state write, provisional
     until judge calibration clears.
   - Northstar: loop integrity (closes the evidence lifecycle honestly).
   - Success metrics:
     - `iterate --mark` sets `proven` only with zero pass^k regression *and* no unresolved contradiction on the affected evals.
   - Dependencies: iterate (F3), evidence lifecycle (Phase 3), contradiction join (Phase 4).
   - Confidence: Medium — design §6.1 `iterate`, §8.

## Dependencies & Sequencing

- Local ordering: `suggest` (F1) → `iterate` proves (F3) → `--mark` (F4); safe
  apply (F2) is the human's landing step after a proven A/B.
- Cross-phase: depends on Phase 5 (`eval new` produced the failing eval and the
  proposal's motivation), Phase 4 (the contradiction gate), and Phase 1 (the runner
  `iterate` re-measures through).

## Phase Metrics & Success Criteria

- This phase is successful when: a maintainer goes from a corroborated finding to a
  drafted, A/B-proven, regression-free proposal — and lands it with a single
  explicit `--apply` while skillet never touches the commit.

## Risks & Assumptions

- The `suggest`/`iterate` engines and content-anchored apply are ported; the
  `--apply` convention is the net-new P5 amendment.
- Suggestion quality depends on the judge; calibration is bounded by the
  contradiction gate until a human-label set exists (Phase 8).

## Phase Change Log

- 2026-06-17: Phase created and spotlighted as its own phase (Northstar gap #2),
  sequenced ahead of the harness matrix within Next.
